On-Chain Charities(OCC) aims to automate and decentralize charitable giving

and fund development within the digital asset ecosystem. We are building a

system top to bottom that will serve as a foundation for executing

individualized philanthropic objectives, while providing a simplified path to

incorporating digital assets as funding sources for non profit organizations

regardless of size or budget.

In the past 10 years, we have experienced the emergence of an entirely new

class of donors, whose giving power lies in the form of digital currencies and

NFTs, providing an unprecedented opportunity for non-profit organizations to

tap into new funding sources.

OCC plans to serve as the go-to platform for non-profit organizations to

solicit and receive digital asset donations. The functionality of the protocol

will consist of two phases of development.

Phase I

Providing a basic introduction to the digital asset ecosystem and unbiased

educational resources for integrating crypto currencies into their existing

banking and accounting structure.





Phase I (cont.)

Providing a customizable donor-facing page and giving features for

organizations on the OCC platform.

The ability to automate and create customizable tax receipts and thank

you communications to donors.

One time, minimal registration fee. All other fees will be incurred by the

donor.

Phase II

Facilitate opportunities for organizations to partner with charitable NFT

projects so that NFT projects users know that they actually are donating

impactful money.

Opportunities to submit RFPs for multi-year funding through OCC’s pooled

impact fund initiatives.

The emergence of digital assets classes have afforded investors tremendous

opportunities for financial gain - blending new technologies with traditional

financial vehicles.





We've seen automation of savings, lending, and borrowing financial instruments-

providing tremendous opportunities for more efficient financial services. With

such rapid technological advancements, we have yet to provide more efficient

charitable planning financial instruments within the digital asset ecosystem. In

the traditional financial system, investors have opportunities to transfer non-cash

equivalent assets to charitable giving vehicles, such as donor-advised funds,

charitable giving annuities, individual foundations and so on. These instruments,

absent in the current digital asset ecosystem, provide advantages in tax and

estate planning, while pursuing philanthropic strategies that bridge community

needs with personal philanthropic goals.

On the donor side, OCC addresses these inefficiencies by providing a new

charitable foundation model within the digital asset ecosystem.

Phase I

Provide a platform to donate digital assets - connecting donors directly to

vetted non-profit organizations of their choice.

Give donors the ability to donate digital assets to impact driven, initiative-

specific pooled funds that support multiple organizations through Request for

Proposals(RFP) and Grants.

Phase II

Use decentralized financial protocols to create charitable giving products for

digital assets such as digital donor-advised funds, family foundations, and

charitable gift annuities.





OnChainCharities.com will be the home platform where all organizations on

our ecosystem will be listed. Enabled by Chainlink Keepers, OCC is an open-

source system that automates the exchange of any erc-20 donated token to

USDC USDT and DAI, then deposits them into an organization's prefered

wallet.

The On-ChainCharitiesWallet will be set up to only receive USDC, USDT, DAI,

& ERC-20 tokens. Beneficiary organizations will be required to use a Multi-

Signature Wallet to withdraw funds to avoid liabilities such as fraud, money

laundering, and extortion. The Multi-signature wallet withdrawal process will

follow a structure comprising of 1 signature for withdrawals from $0-$500, 2

signatures for withdrawals $500-$5000, 3 signatures for withdrawal

$5,000-$25,000, and for $25,000+ withdrawals we require 3 signatures from

the charities and 2 sig from OCCp admins to quantify what they are using the

donation for. Zero Knowledge Proofs will generate automated receipts without

the need for the protocol to store private user data.

OCC will utilize Proof of Reserves to validate the amount of funds locked in

the OCCt Pool and use deep liquidity Decentralized Exchanges to facilitate

the sale of erc-20 tokens.

For example, OCCp receives a predetermined gift of an erc-20 token from a

donor to their desired non-profit organization.





The OCCp then sells it on a deep liquidity defi-protocol to USDC/USDT/DAI

and finally will transfer the converted capital directly to the predetermined

charities wallet all on chain to be seen on a blockchain transaction viewer.

Our receipt generation protocol uses ZKP (Zero Knowledge Proofs) to

generate automatic receipts based upon the amount donated.
