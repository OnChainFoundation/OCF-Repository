# OnChain Foundation Whitepaper

## Mission

On-Chain Foundation(OCF) is a C-Corp based in Wyoming that aims to automate and decentralize charitable giving and fund development within the digital asset ecosystem. We are building a system top to bottom that will serve as a foundation for executing individualized and corprate philanthropic objectives within the digital asset ecosystem, while providing a simplified & affordable path to incorporating digital assets as funding sources for non profit organizations regardless of size or budget.  

## Onboarding Non-profit Organizations into the Digital Asset Ecosystem

In the past 10 years, we have experienced the emergence of an entirely new class of donors, whose giving power lies in the form of digital currencies and NFTs, providing an unprecedented opportunity for non-profit organizations to tap into new funding sources.  

OCF plans to serve as the go-to platform for non-profit organizations to solicit and receive digital asset donations. The on-boarding process for NPO's will consist of two phases of development.  

### Phase 1

- Providing a basic introduction to the digital asset ecosystem and unbiased educational resources for integrating crypto currencies into their existing banking and accounting structure. 
- Provide a customizable donor-facing page on their existing website to connect to OCF protocol and display giving features for organizations on the OCF platform. 
- The ability to create and automate the generation of official tax receipts and thank you communications to donors.   
- Establishing multi-signature wallet functionality to help quantify our donors impact & eliminate risk.   

### Phase 2

- Facilitate opportunities for organizations to partner with charitable NFT projects so that NFT projects users know that they actually are donating impactful money.
- Opportunities to submit RFPs for multi-year funding through OCFâ€™s impact fund initiatives.

## Bringing the Traditional Community Foundation Model On-Chain

The emergence of digital assets classes have afforded investors tremendous opportunities for financial gain - blending new technologies with traditional financial vehicles. 

We've seen automation of savings, lending, and borrowing financial instruments- providing tremendous opportunities for more efficient financial services. With such rapid technological advancements, we have yet to provide more efficient and open source charitable planning financial instruments within the digital asset ecosystem. In the traditional financial system, investors have opportunities to transfer non-cash equivalent assets to charitable giving vehicles, such as donor-advised funds, charitable giving annuities, individual foundations and so on. These instruments, absent in the current digital asset ecosystem,  provide advantages in tax and estate planning, while pursuing philanthropic strategies that bridge community needs with personal philanthropic goals. 

On the donor side, OCF addresses these inefficiencies by providing a new charitable foundation model within the digital asset ecosystem.

### Phase 1

- Provide a platform to donate digital assets - connecting donors directly to vetted non-profit organizations of their choice. 
- Give donors the ability to donate digital assets to impact driven, initiative-specific pooled funds that support multiple organizations through Request for Proposals(RFP) and Grants.  

### Phase 2

- Use decentralized financial protocols to create charitable giving products for digital assets such as digital donor-advised funds, family foundations, and charitable gift annuities.

## How It Works

[OnChainFoundation.com](https://onchainfoundation.github.io/OCF-Repository/) will be the home platform where all organizations on our ecosystem will be listed. We will also create micro-sites on the NPO's existing website that connects them directly to our protocol.   OnChain Foundation Protocol (OFCp) is enabled by Chainlink Keepers, Chainlink Price Feeds, and decentralized liquidity. OCFp is an open-source system that automates the exchange of any erc-20 that has a registered Chainlink price feed, into a preferred stable coin.  OCFp then transfers the preferred stable coin into an organization's designated wallet using Chainlink Keepers.

The OCF NPO wallet will be set up to only receive USDC, USDT, DAI, & ETH. Beneficiary organizations will be required to use a multi-signature wallet to withdraw funds to avoid liabilities such as fraud, money laundering, and extortion. The multi-signature wallet withdrawal process will follow a structure comprising of 1 signature for withdrawals from $0-$2000, 2 signatures for withdrawals $2000-$5000, 3 signatures for withdrawal $5,000-$25,000, and for $25,000+ withdrawals we require 3 signatures from the charities and 2 signatures from OCFp admins. 

Zero Knowledge Proofs will be used to generate automated receipts without the need for OnChain Foundation to custodian private user data such as address and full name.

## Pricing & Revenue

Last year in the United States alone, charitable giving topped more than $470 billion. What's more, individuals with cryptocurrency were more likely to donate $1000 + to charitable causes. 

OCF plans to be the go-to destination for philanthropic services in the digital asset ecosystem by removing costly barriers into crypto for NPOs while providing the most robust toolkit of philanthropic financial vehicles. We believe that these two features will offer both NPOs & donors the best interactive experience and thus position us for robust revenue growth and market share.
